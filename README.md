# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Traffic-Lights---PADI-course-at-IST


This was a project for an Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems during my Informatics and Computer Engineering Masters specializing in Intelligent Systems and Data Analysis and Processing at IST.

The objective was to implement an environment with traffic lights capable of using reinforcement learning to better control the flow of traffic between two intersections. Several algorithms as well as environment representations were tested and a final analysis was done in a report. A video shows the agents in action in an environment developed in the Unity Game Engine.

In the end our agents were able to achieve better performance than the na√Øve approach of changing lights every predetermined X amount of time that is, at the time of writing, still a used approach in intersections in the real world.
